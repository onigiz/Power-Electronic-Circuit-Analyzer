# ITU-Python-Homework
* The homework is given by ITU Electric-Electronic Faculty, and is created for a Python-based class project. We are doing some math calculations for some power electronics circuits.

* Values are taken from users for specific circuits and calculations will be made. In the project, there is a user interface for taking inputs, showing outputs and showing the circuits.

* Also, the user can take a few error messages etc. when something is wrong with inputs or circuits.

* PythonFiles folder contains python files in the project.
  We run it through the run.py file.
  In MainOperations.py, there are operations that are made in the main window and make up the original of the project.
  In OtherClasses.py, windows other than the main window are converted from .ui files to python codes.
  mplwidget.py, on the other hand, is the python code of the widget used to draw graphics, which is not actually included in QtDesigner.

There are files with .ui extension for which we designed the interface in GUIPages. Same folder, IMGInterface located in
The folder contains the images used in the project.

## ---Libraries Used---
-PyQt5
-matplotlib
-numpy

NOTE: In addition to libraries, QT Designer was used for the visual design of the interfaces.
